L: Finch
R: Robin Peep
Finch: Alright losers, give back the fossils you stole.
Robin: We never stole any fossils. These bones were bought online.
Finch: But…the T-Rex….and the event last night.
L: Finch Peacock
Peacock: I tried to tell you, but they’re fake. Made of plastic. That T-Rex has too many ribs to be a real skeleton. 
Finch: Speak up before I embarrass myself next time!
Robin: What’s this about stolen bones?
L: Finch Hawk
Hawk: Magpie stole some dinosaur bones, and now we’re on the chase! She said she gave ‘em to someone last night at the track field.
Peep: We didn’t, like, see any magpie. 
Peep: But there was that one fan, who was like “OMG You have dinosaur bones? So do I. This must be destiny!”
Peep: Tried really hard to make it a thing.
L: Peacock Hawk
Peacock: That could be our lead! Can you tell us more about this fan? Any identifying features?
Peep: …
Peep: ...
Peep: He had a bowler hat?
Peacock: Oh come on, that’s-
L: Peacock Hawk Swan
Swan: -all we needed to know.
Swan: Let’s leave. At least party-crashing wasn’t a complete waste of time.
L: Finch
R: Robin
Robin: You know, Goldfinch, you haven’t lost your stage presence one bit. We’d, like, love to have you back in the band.
Robin: But you know, since it’s a boy-band-
Finch: Screw you. I’m leaving with my actual friends.
