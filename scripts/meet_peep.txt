L: Hawk
R: Sparrow
Sparrow: Grrr…you’ll...pay.... *thud*
R: 
Hawk: Woah, these fans are nuts!
R: Robin
Robin: Now now, don’t be so hard on my passionate fans.
L: Finch Hawk
Finch: Oh, shut up Robin.
Robin: I expected you to, like, buy our tickets and get drunk in the back, not start fights with your former fans. 
Finch: I don’t know what you’re talking about. I have nothing to do with you!
L: Finch Swan
Swan: You yelled out your entire backstory already.
L: Finch Swan Peacock
Peacock: Your feather clips are just their sunglasses split into half. 
Finch: *sweats* So what if PEEP sold me out. They have the bones, and we’re taking them back.
L: Finch Peacock
Peacock: Actually, about the bones-
Robin: The T-Rex skeleton is the star of the show! If you want it, you’ll have to put on a bigger performance tonight.
L: Finch Hawk
Hawk: I’ve always wanted to sing on-stage!
Robin: Let’s, like, make it more even. A band-battle. Your misfit crew can try to stitch itself together.
Finch: My friends may be different, but we can all kick your botox’ed butt!
Robin: Hah! No one can beat PEEP’s impenetrable defense!
