Peacock: Yes, we just found it mysteriously lying around in the garbage.

Hawk: Woohoo, feels good to save the day!
Finch: And it feels like, like, we all grew up too.
Peacock: Except me, but that’s to be expected.
Swan: Wait a minute…

L: Swan
Swan: Where’s our reward? We never got the promised $100.
L: Swan Hawk
Hawk: Bro, aren’t you satisfied with the warm feeling in your heart after doing the right thing?
Swan: I want money.
L: Swan Peacock
Peacock: And Mr. Pheasant might let me help out more after today! Maybe I can start writing articles, or cleaning artifacts. If he’s really happy, I could even lead tours inside!
L: Finch Peacock
Finch: You need, like, way higher standards.
R: Quail
Quail: Oh, Peacock! What are you doing here? The museum’s hours are long over.
Peacock: Maybe we shouldn’t bother them. I mean, we could always get the money tomorrow.
L: Swan Peacock
Swan: Hold your ground. For the money.
Peacock: Okay. We’re here to talk to Mr. Pheasant. Could you let us in?
Quail: I already locked up the museum. And besides, the girls and I are going for board game night after he let us leave early.
R: Quail Chickens
Peacock: I love board games! May I join?
Quail: No.
L: Finch Peacock
Finch: Oh snap, P. You can’t just take that lying down.
L: Peacock
Peacock: *Holds cup* ...Are you still looking for that strawberry vanilla chai decaf latte with fat free almond milk and two hazelnut shots?
Quail: Yes! Thank you very much, Peacock. You’ve always been family to us, you know?
Peacock: *flips drink* Oops. *Spills on Ms. Quail* Hope I didn’t ruin your feather paint. I know how much you need Mr. Pheasant to see you as a clown.
Quail: How…
Quail: *turns red* …DARE YOU!
