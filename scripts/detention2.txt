# Should be a modified background with silhouette of pheasant in window
L: Hawk Finch
R: Ground_Dove Rock_Pigeon
Hawk: Scram, dudes! I’m not buying your candy! For now.
Rock_Pigeon: Ooogh...you’ll pay for this, friend.
Ground_Dove: Aaagh…with interest!
R: !Ground_Dove(fades) !Rock_Pigeon(fades)
Finch: Thank god they’re gone. At least detention wasn’t so boring this time.
R: Shadowy_Figure
Shadowy_Figure: That was some excellent combat, you two.
# Might do something with background here
Shadowy_Figure: If you want to do something more worth your time, I have a potential errand for you.
Hawk: I dunno, dude. Might not be allowed to do try-outs if I skip detention.
Finch: Errands? I’d rather do, like, anything else.
Shadowy_Figure: I’ll give you an allowance of sorts. How does $100 sound?
L: Hawk Finch Swan
Swan: I’m in.
Finch: You didn’t even fight!
Shadowy_Figure: The more wings the merrier. If you two ladies change your mind, come to the museum at 4:30. Ask for a Mr. Pheasant.
R: !Shadowy_Figure
Hawk: Detention ends at five…
R: Teacher
Teacher: zzz
R: !Teacher
Hawk: Let’s go!
