L: Finch Peacock
R: Bluejay Magpie
Bluejay: stop…ugh…*thud *
R: !Bluejay(fades) Magpie
Finch: Alright, Magpie, where’d you take those dinosaur bones?
Magpie: I never stole any dinosaur bones! I’ve never seen dinosaur bones in my entire life.
Peacock: We...caught you on camera last night!
Magpie: Impossible! I disabled them…I meant, avoided them. Because I was never there. *sweats* 
L: Swan Peacock
Swan: Tell us everything about those bones, unless you want me to squeeze it out the swan-fashioned way.
Magpie: Okay, okay, I took the bones last night! I was just told to bring the loot to the track field by my client. And I did. It was a clean job.
Swan: Who did you give the bones to?
Magpie: I don’t know. It was dark, and they were covering their face. I’m sorry, that’s really all I can tell you!
R: Bluejay Magpie
Bluejay: What’s going on…hey, you! How dare you assault an officer of the law? Do you know what kind of charges you’ll face?
Hawk: We did nothing wrong. Magpie’s the one you should be arresting!
Swan: She stole dinosaur fossils. We captured her. You’re welcome.
Magpie: I’m innocent. Never broke the law before.
Swan: Ahem.
Magpie: I stole Mr. Pheasant’s dinosaur bones.
Bluejay: Well, it appears this whole incident was a misunderstanding. I must apologize. I came to the wrong conclusions after your…company.
Swan: …
Peacock: Thank you for letting this go, Bluejay. Mr. Pheasant will be ecstatic to have his thief locked up.
Bluejay: Yes, yes, don’t tell him a word about this fight, understood? Not a peep. Now, be off with you, kids.
L: 
Bluejay: Magpie, you’re coming with me.
Magpie: No.
R: Bluejay
Bluejay: …
