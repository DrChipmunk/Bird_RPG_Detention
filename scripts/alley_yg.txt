Finch: ...
Peacock: (Oh, what do I do? What do I say? This silence is so awkward! I don’t know how to talk about anything other than school.)
Finch: Peacock?
Peacock: Yeah? (Come on, she’s your friend. She won’t judge you if you talk about school. But school’s such a boring topic!)
Finch: What’s school like for you?
Peacock: School? School’s cool! School’s my favorite subject in school. I’m sorry, I mean, school is a place. That I enjoy. Why do you ask?
Finch: Out of us four, you seem to be the only one who actually, like, cares about it. What’s so great about school?
Peacock: Good grades lead to good universities, which will hopefully lead to better work than my stupid unpaid internship. I just want financial freedom. 
Finch: Wow, I thought you were going to say something lame like, ‘I love reading!’
Finch: You’re right though. I’ve been trying to find what I can do since I left PEEP last year. I did try, but school just doesn’t like me.
Peacock: Surely there’s not no subject you do well. 
Finch: I’m good at looking pretty and singing, not being smart.
Peacock: Goldfinch, you’re already smarter than half of my coworkers.. Maybe you just forgot how to study after being with PEEP for so long. I’ll teach you until we find what you like!
Finch: Thanks, sweetie. I’ll give it a try

R: Goose
Goose: What the-shoo! If you keep snooping I’ll start shooting!
Peacock: Please don’t shoot! We’re just talking about...school.
Goose: Like I’d fall for that. You’ve poked your beak in our nest too many times.
Finch: Like, do I know you?
Peacock: He joined Bluejay to protect Magpie. That means he must want to stop us from getting the bones! 
Finch: Oh my gosh, you’re right!
Goose: *Sweats * That was another goose. 
Peacock:  Another goose with the exact same hat?
Finch: Give back the bones and we’ll go easy.
Goose: Don’t get cocky, kids. You got it easy around Bluejay, but I’m not showing any mercy now!
