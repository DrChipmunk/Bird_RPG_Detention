L: Swan
R: Duck
Duck: Black! It’s so good to see you! Welcome home!
Duck:...who’s this.
L: Swan Hawk
Swan: ‘She’s Hawk, my girlfriend.’
Duck: *sigh * I’ve always known that this day would come. Of course someone as handsome as you would one day bring back...a girl.
Swan: ‘Thanks, I hope you like her.’ For once. 
Hawk: (Wow! I’ve already won Duck over!)
Duck: Gah! I’m still not finished! I need to know How long have you two been dating?
Hawk: How long have we been dating?
Swan: ‘Two months’
Hawk: Yeah, the two months have been such a blast. I love my bro! I meant brofriend. Boyfriend. 
Swan: Focus!
Duck: *shaking angrily * How could you say you love him if you’ve only dated him for two months? Love happens through growing with them over a lifetime! Like since childhood!
Hawk: Well, our backstory is so cool it adds five years! ‘It all started when…’ (Oh no! I forgot the story for how Swan met me. I don’t think it involved backflips, but that's all that I can remember!)
Hawk: (It’s okay. Just do what you do best. Wing it!)
Hawk: ‘Backstory doesn’t matter. I love him. Because I’m asking for his wing...in marriage!’
Swan: One thing, Hawk. I told you not to say one thing!
Duck: Preposterous! Black, you absolutely cannot marry this hussy after only two months. She’s a gold digger!
Swan: Calm down, Duck, she’s not actually my-
Duck: I will defend your honor with my life. Hawk, prepare to duel!
