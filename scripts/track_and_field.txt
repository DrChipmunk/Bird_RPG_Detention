R: Eagle Jocks
Jocks: Hoo-Haa! Hoo-Haa!
L: Hawk Finch
Finch: Ew, watching them is giving me second-hand sweat. I need, like, ten showers.
Hawk: What’s up dudes?
Eagle: Dude, where were you? Tryouts are tomorrow! 
Hawk: Sorry bro, got detention and bone hunting. We gotta use the field now.
Eagle: Bro, you know how much we need the field. Team’s going places!
Jocks: Third places! Third places!
Eagle: Let’s be fair sports here. What about a match for the field, bro? Your team against mine!
Hawk: Uhh...time out. Group huddle!
R: Peacock Swan
Hawk: We can’t beat them. 
Swan: After Bluejay and Magpie, they’re the opponents you’re afraid of?
Hawk: They’re buff as T-Rexes, dude!
Peacock: I hate to say it, but we can’t give up here. Mr. Pheasant might give me a negative salary if the bones are lost.
Hawk: Surely we can find another clue elsewhere. 
Swan: You’ll have to face this team anyways if you’re trying out. Think of this as a practice run. 
Hawk: But what if they think I’m so pathetic that they ban me from tryouts tomorrow?
Finch: Hawk, have faith in your own power. And if you can’t, can you at least have faith in ours?
Hawk: ...I’ll do my best. 
L: Hawk Finch
R: Eagle Jocks
Hawk: We’ll take you on! 
Eagle: Bro, do they even lift?
L: Hawk Swan
Swan: …
L: Hawk Peacock
Peacock: …
Hawk: Oh no...we’re going to lose...
L: Hawk Finch
Finch: Lifting isn’t everything to fighting, you know? We’ll prove it to you!
Eagle: Gotta get swole, bro! How else are you gonna get full power?
Hawk: My team’s...metaphorically ripped, dude. Get ready to get wrecked!
