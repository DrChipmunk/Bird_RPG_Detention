R: Quail Chickens
L: Peacock
Chickens, with coffee cups over their heads: ….
Quail: Urgh…I want to hurl…
Peacock: You’d feel less sickly if you didn’t drink overpriced caffeinated sewage.
Quail: Insulting Starbeaks? You’ve crossed the line, kid.
Quail: You’re fired! Permanently banned from the museum! Don’t even think about that job reference. 
Peacock: Wonderful! When I head out for university, you’re not going to cross my mind one bit. I already know you’ll tear each other apart without an intern to bully. Have fun sitting around and gathering dust like the exhibits, you mouth-breathers! 
Quail: You...you… *faints*
R: 
L: Peacock Hawk
Hawk: Great job, bro! You destroyed her! 
Peacock: ....I should really forget about that job reference now. 
L: Peacock Swan
Swan: I’ll pay you my share of the reward if you repeat that to Mr. Pheasant. 
Peacock: Would Mr. Pheasant still give us any rewards after what we did to his staff?
L: Peacock Finch
Finch: We keep each other’s secrets, sweetie.
L: Hawk Finch
Hawk: Now let’s get rich! *Takes rock and throws it off screen*
