L: Swan
R: Duck
Duck: Black! You’re home! It’s so good to see you again!
Duck: ...who’s this?
L: Swan Finch
R: Duck
Swan: ‘She’s Goldfinch, my girlfriend.’ 
Duck: *sigh * I’ve always known that this day would come. Of course someone as handsome as you would bring back...a girl.
Swan: ‘Thanks, I hope you like her.’ For once. 
Finch: (Omigosh, this is hilarious.)
Duck: Wait a minute. She’s the girl who crashed the PEEP concert! And beat them up on stage! 
Swan: I also, if you remember, did that.
Duck: I-I do remember! But you were polite as always. She said some truly offensive things about them. 
Finch: Like, the fact that they can’t dance? Or act like eggs on social media? And you can’t actually believe that they don’t beak sync during their live performances, right?
Duck: How dare you!
Swan: Don’t rile him up any more. 
Finch: Let me have a little fun! 
Finch: Oh, and after trampolining on PEEP’s fat chests, Swan and I needed a little privacy. There was just so much energy, if you know what I mean.
Swan: The train’s already a wreck. Stop, please. 
Finch: Anyways! We went to the back, and you could say I was feeling...peckish. 
Duck: *vibrating angrily* Keep away from him, you lascivious harpy! Even if I have no chance, I won’t let you sully his honor. 
Swan: Hold on, she’s not actually-
Duck: Goldfinch, prepare to duel!
