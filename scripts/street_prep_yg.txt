L: Swan
R: Hawk
Swan: ...and that’s the story we’re going with, got it? 
Hawk: Too many words and too little backflips. Since we’re super in love, I should just say, ‘I’m here to ask for his wing...in marriage!’
Swan: There’s no way my friend would believe you if we’ve only been dating for two months. 
Hawk: That’s not how fast it goes? Pretending to be dating is way too hard. If I just call you my bro, we’d get in like a breeze.
Swan: Don’t you remember? He gets territorial. Insists that my friends aren’t good enough and drives them off. 
Hawk: Dude, he sounds like an awful friend. Bros don’t make bros more lonely!
Swan: I know that! But I don’t blame him. Our background has never involved trusting others. It takes a lot to reach out to new people. 
Hawk: Well, you did it today with us. And now you’ve got three new friends!
Swan: Now’s too soon to make that declaration. Not many want to stay after they find out what I do.  
Hawk: I got sent to detention after a candy bust, dude. I’m sure whatever mothballs you’ve got in the closet aren’t going to chase the others away either.
Hawk: And if it does, I’ll chase them right back to you! Because that’s what friends do.
Swan: You always find the simple answer, Hawk. Thank you.
Swan: We’ve kept the others waiting long enough. Let’s go.
