L: Hawk Finch Swan
Hawk: Woah! I didn’t know we had such a large museum.
Finch: It’s like, the only building taller than a house here.
R: Peacock
Peacock: Welcome to the Museum of Avian History! Are you here to enjoy our seasonal dinosaur collection?
Swan: We need to see Mr. Pheasant. 
Peacock: Welcome to-sorry. I meant, Mr. Pheasant told me about you. He’s waiting for you just right this way.
N: Peacock, our final hero, was too nervous about how detention would affect his chances of getting into college to get into any trouble. Until today.
